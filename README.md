# foo-snap
42.

Started as a funny idea and ended with me not having permission to upload a snap with the name **foo** to the store.
Anyway you can install it locally:

Usage
-----

Ensure you have Git installed, and clone the repository to your local machine from GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/foo-snap.git
```
`cd` into the new directory
```
cd foo-snap
```
Install the snap
```
sudo snap install foo_0.1_amd64.snap --dangerous
```
Run the snap
```
foo
```
